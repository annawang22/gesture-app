"could you write a python script that uses mediapipe (https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/gesture_recognizer/index#models) to capture an image of a gesture and sends back a label using flask and render.com? prioritize simplicity in code and provide me lots of comments so it's easy to debug."

variations of: "this is what my terminal/render logs are returning: '...' is this what i'm supposed to see? if not, how do i fix this? and what should i expect to see?"

for example,
"i got Status: 500
Response: <html>
  <head>
    <title>Internal Server Error</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><p>Internal Server Error</p></h1>
    
  </body>
</html>again what do i do?"

"i got the same error again: HTTP/2 500 date: Mon, 16 Feb 2026 13:34:07 GMT content-type: text/html cf-ray: 9ced67486aed54bb-IAD rndr-id: 718e33d8-3e70-4561 vary: Accept-Encoding x-render-origin-server: Render cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC server: cloudflare alt-svc: h3=":443"; ma=86400 <html> <head> <title>Internal Server Error</title> </head> <body> <h1><p>Internal Server Error</p></h1> </body> </html>"
