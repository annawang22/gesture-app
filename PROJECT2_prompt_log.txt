Debugging no GPU on Render issue:
when i run this command "curl --max-time 600 -i -X POST "https://gesture-app-restart.onrender.com/predict" -F "image=@/Users/hfang2/Downloads/thumbsup.jpg"",  i get stuck in the recognizer_top_label function. can you please help me debug this?

what does this error in render mean "Running 'gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --worker-class gthread --workers 1 --threads 4 --timeout 600 --graceful-timeout 600 --access-logfile - --error-logfile -'"

when i run the code locally it works, but it doesn't work with render, what do i do?

can you edit recognize_top_label to see if the function is timing out?

this is what my error log looks like: Step 1: creating mp.Image...
Step 1 done: mp.Image created. elapsed=0.001s
Step 2: calling recognizer.recognize()...
==> Detected service running on port 10000
==> Docs on specifying a port: https://render.com/docs/web-services#port-binding

i downloaded python3 -m pip install psutil on my local computer, however, it's not importing into vscode. it gives me a squiggly line underneath psutil and when i run my code, "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psutil'". Could you provide me a solution to this?

could you generate me a frontend to this current backend project that is on the web/browser? can you specify whether i would need to create a new github repository or not? be clear on what i should see when i run the code?  i want a simple frontend to begin with.
    Q: How do you want to capture the image in the browser?
    A: Live webcam feed with a capture button

    Q: Where is your backend currently running?
    A: On Render (live URL)

why is errors in the 500s more serious than those in the 400s?

explain this in more detail. why do we need a fresh recognizer per request? and why does the GPU vs CPU concept matter?

what is the purpose of

```python
# Local dev entrypoint (Render will use gunicorn instead)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # For local testing: python app.py
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000, debug=True)?
```

could you provide me code with a stop camera button?


if i got 

```html
'Network error — is your Render URL correct and the server awake?' 
```

how should i go about resolving this?

so app.py on Render returns JSON, what file does this JSON go to so that the result is displayed in the browser UI?

this is my current code. i added a gestureHandler function in index.html. i now want to connect to the Spotify API so that if i point my finger up, it'll go to the next song. if i hold a fist, it will stop the song and if i hold a open palm, it will start/resume the song. could you give me a step by step guide on achieving this? be sure to remind me where and what to place in my gitignore.

can i test that this works before doing the next step? if so, what should i expect to be seeing?

when i paste it into the spotify web api setting i get that "This redirect URI is not secure. Learn more __here__."....

instead it brought me to a page that says "INVALID_CLIENT: Invalid redirect URI"
    that's not it. i did everything you told me, i'm still getting the same error

entered console.log(SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI) into the "Console" tab after clicking "Inspect", this is what it prints out: VM218:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI is not defined
    at <anonymous>:1:13

im getting that "this site cannot be reached"

now im recieving "response_type must be code"

i did what you told me. i received the same error: "response_type must be code"

i got the old error again:INVALID_CLIENT: Invalid redirect URI

okay now on when i press agree to for spotify to connect me, i get brought to a page that says "Error response
Error code: 404
Message: File not found.
Error code explanation: HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND - Nothing matches the given URI." 
Then in the terminal i have: ":ffff:127.0.0.1 - - [26/Feb/2026 17:21:46] code 404, message File not found
::ffff:127.0.0.1 - - [26/Feb/2026 17:21:46] "GET /callback?code=AQDPWl3V9dCpyk3BPNjpbWJgmgG-DwMTy4F_LsMPFMb1-lOlQbC8JKcL8BDowmCuUbfK5b55zNitt_SjrqoXJIVLzcr9Y8P3vAxH4EIseFqrukW2bhZUXKrzKpCSn3U826G0PxY7koTa4dnSPThHutHhU_Kv_SrVBg2gA2vd7r70V_BkzfHH5y0aooQtErO5rBvr3u0vFY2UwBsIs9TyWi3GlkNIkrgB7eawQ_ZeYHZvdOdXAl7ScOlJ6uINNEyfH7lt-xlWn2FuivNAtwLEjyh8DRUtlgs8Nrbkj0NqhbAFTI5x2-bh_Ug4UA HTTP/1.1" 404 -

I don't think that's the solution because i was brought to this error "INVALID_CLIENT: Invalid redirect URI". however, when i use the callback, it brings me the attached file. (file was a picture of Spotify trying to connect me).

clicked Agree and this is what happened "Error response
Error code: 404
Message: File not found.
Error code explanation: HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND - Nothing matches the given URI."

a gesture is detected but Spotify doesn't respond. is it because im playing spotify from my desktop or does that not matter?

pointing up works (meaning it goes to the next song). however, when i do a closed fist or an open palm it doesn't pause or resume the song respectively how should i go about fixing this?
    why should i do this? why would this fix this? and why without it was it not working?

how do i allow people to login with their own spotify account?

where do i find the link to my website? or is http://127.0.0.1:8888/ my permanent link?

i made the github link and now when i open it, when i press the connect spotify button it doesn't do anything

can i just replace the current callback url in my spotify_config.js with my github link or will this not work?

are you sure i can push spotify_config.js?

ChatGPT Prompts:
if i have a backend and simple frontend already that does gesture recognition. now i want to connect recognizing gestures to control my spotify. for example, if i show a fist, i want to stop the music. if i point up, it will go to the next song. should i be using the spotify webplayback SDK or should i be using the spotify api? 

do you think that i should first do somethiing like if you see a pointing up gesture, increase the volume on my computer first and then have it connect to spotify so i can gurantee that it works bit by bit? or should i go straight from recognizing gestures to connecting it to the spotify api?

i forgot to mention that i am not doing live motion yet. im still doing like i capture an image and then send it.
